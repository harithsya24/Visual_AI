# SafetyWalk

## Overview

This project uses the VisDrone dataset for object detection and tracking in urban environments. The VisDrone dataset contains images and annotations for various scenarios, including pedestrian detection, vehicle detection, and more.

## Dataset Description

The VisDrone dataset consists of:

- **Images**: A collection of high-resolution images captured in diverse urban settings.
- **Annotations**: Information about detected objects within the images, including bounding boxes and labels for different object classes.

## Usage

### Load the Dataset

Update the paths to your local image and annotation files in the script you create for loading the dataset.

### Preprocessing

Preprocess the images as needed. You can resize images and normalize them for your model.

### Training

Implement your training script using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to train your model on the loaded dataset.
